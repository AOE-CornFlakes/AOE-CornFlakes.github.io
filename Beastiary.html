	<h2 style= "text-align:center">Glyphids</h2>
	</div>
	<p style= "text-align:center">Glyphids are the creatures you will encounter the most frequently on your ventures. 
	They come in many different sizes, ranging from the pesky swarmer to the mighty dreadnaught. 
	When it comes to fighting most Glyphids, just keep your distance and try to shoot at their soft underbellies. 
	If their carapace takes enough damage, you can crack through to reveal its soft skin; however, 
	this process does take more time, and leaves you susceptible to being overwhelmed. </p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3 style= "text-align:center">Glyphid Grunts</h3>
	</div>
	<p style= "text-align:center">Currently we know of three different variations of the Glyphid grunt. 
	These are the Glyphids you are most likely to encounter as you tunnel through the depths of Hoxxes. 
	They typically come in swarms, so as always, try to keep as much distance from you and the swarm 
	of teeth eagerly awaiting to get at you. </p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Normal Glyhpid Grunts</h4>
	</div>
	<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/1/10/Glyphid_grunt.png/revision/latest?cb=20190315181221" width="400" height="300" alt="Grunt">
	<p>The Glyphid Grunt is by far the most common type of Glyphid encountered on Hoxxes, usually encountered in roving packs. Small (relatively speaking) and agile, it is a versatile and aggressive hunter that remains exceptionally hostile to any encroachment on their territory. </p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glyphid Grunt Slashers</h4>
	</div>
	<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/f/fd/Glyphid_Slasher.png/revision/latest?cb=20190317135730" width="400" height="300" alt="Grunt Slasher">
	<p>Variations of grunts that possess sharper teeth and longer, sharper claws than most grunts. Easily able to strike through your armor. </p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glyphid Grunt Guards</h4>
	</div>
	<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/9/96/Glyphid_Guard.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20190317135635" width="400" height="300" alt="Grunt Guard">
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3 style= "text-align:center"> Glyphid Spitter variations</h3>
	</div>
	<p style= "text-align:center">“Spitter glyphids” usually try and climb on walls and spit substances at you from afar 
	to help support the swarm. They are typically quite frail, so a 
	few well placed shots can dispatch of them quite quickly. Not that they should be ignored,
	Spitters are often more dangerous than the swarms of grunts coming to attack you due to 
	their ability to strike you from afar. </p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glyphid Web spitters</h4>
	</div>
	<img src ="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/a/a3/Glyphid_spitter.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/120?cb=20171115124203" width="400" height="300" alt="Pixelated Web Spitter">
	<p>Purple glyphids that spit webs at you to slow you down. Typically more of a nuisance,
	but can be dangerous if you are trying to run from an oncomming swarm.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Acid Spitters</h4> 
	</div>
	<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/6/61/Glyphid_acid_spitter.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20181102070950" width="400" height="300" alt="Acid spitter">
	<p>Red glyphids that spit acid at you. Highly dangerous and a high priority.</p> 
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3 style= "text-align:center">Glyphid Praetorians</h3> 
	</div>
	<p style= "text-align:center">Large, green, and have a large, front facing carapace. They have the ability to spew green 
	acid from their mouths and emit a noxious but flammable green cloud upon death. All praetorians have a noticeable, 
	green bulb on their backside where they store their energy. They are slow moving, 
	so it is relatively easy to get around them and attack their backside; however, 
	this does not account for the swarms of grunts that usually accompany them.</p>
	<p style= "text-align:center"> <em>~~NOTE: The photos presented to not show the creatures backside. This is because our photographers sent to take
	photos of the creatures where eaten. Use your imagination while we get another photgraphy crew to update this catalog~~</em></p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Standard Glyphid Praetorians</h4> 
	</div>
	<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/3/3b/Glyphid_Praetorian.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/699?cb=20171115124247"  width="400" height="300" alt="Standard Praetorian">
	<p>Your standard Praetorian. Slow and tough, typically guarded by other glyphids</p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glyphid Oppressors</h4>
	</div>
	<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/3/37/Glyphid_Oppressor.png/revision/latest?cb=20200120172551" width="400" height="300" alt="Oppressor">
	<p>Mutations of standard praetorians. Larger, slower but much tougher. Their
	bulb is less exposed as nearly their entire body is covered in a strong, near 
	impenetrable carapace, making any attacks not focused on their bulb hardly noticeable. 
	Should be a high priority on any mission if you are capable of safely maneuvering around it. </p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3 style= "text-align:center">Glyphid Detonators</h3> 
	</div>
	<p style= "text-align:center">Red glyphids with no carapace that have yellowish/orange sacs caused by the exploder mutation. 
	Highly dangerous. Resarchers are still trying to uncover the purpose of the exloder mutation.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glpyhid Exploders</h4>
	</div>
	<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/f/f6/Glyphid_exploder.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20200716131635" width="400" height="300" alt="Exploder">
	<p>Grunt sized. Will explode when close to you as a sacrificial attempt to kill you and remove 
	you as a threat to the swarm of bugs coming to your team. Stay away from them.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glyphid Bulk Detonators</h4>
	</div>
	<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/f/fd/Glyphid_Bulk_Detonator.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190317135602" width="400" height="300" alt="Bulk Detonator">
	<p>Very large. The deadliest form of a glyphid you will likely encounter and is 
	what happens when a detenator is able to survive for long enough. Noticeable by 
	a distinct “laughter” if nearby.  Capable of doing more damage than a dreadnought, 
	though not as quick or as healthy as a dreadnought. Very 
	tough to take down. If you see one, try to put as much distance from you and it as 
	possible. If you are forced to engage with one. Aim for its large yellow bulbs covering 
	its body. Upon death, it will let out a massive explosion to try and take you with it. So, again,
	DO NOT STAND CLOSE TO ONE! Unless your goal is an express ticket back to medbay. That is if your team is able to
	recovers your remains.</p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3 style= "text-align:center">Other Glyphids</h3>
	</div>
	<p style= "text-align:center">These are glyphids that don't fall under any variation catagories.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glyhpid Menaces</h4>
	</div>
	<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/3/3a/Glyphid_Menace.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20190317135643" width="400" height="300" alt="Menace">
	<p>Light blue with light blue sacs to carry its acid. It typically 
	fire a barrage of acid less potent than the acid spitter, 
	but is incredibly lethal if all of its shots connect. Make a distinct gargling sound as they prepare to spit.
	Aim for the sacs.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glyphid Wardens</h4>
	</div>
	<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/e/ef/Glyphid_Warden.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20190317135724" width="400" height="300" alt="Wardens">
	<p>A new breed of glyphid that was recently discovered.
	Wardens disburse energy that enhances nearby glyphids, making all of them more resilient. 
	It has a white carapace, pink underbody, and a purple bulb that it uses to disburse its energy. 
	Try to focus them down during swarms if present, the resiliency it 
	provides nearby Glyphids is very noticeable.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h4>Glyphid Swarmers</h4>
	</div>
	<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/5/50/Glyphid_swarmer.png/revision/latest?cb=20171114165935" width="400" height="300" alt="Swarmers">
	<p>Swarmers are the smallest species of glpyhids we know of so far.
	They act as larval stages to grunts. Despite being young, their teeth
	are still razor sharp, still presenting themselves as a threat. Keep
	in mind that your boots can also serve as an effective weapon against them.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<!-- I didn't learn this before resarching it but apperentley brood nexuses aren't glpyhids
	so they won't exist here -->
	<h4> Glyphid Dreadnoughts </h4>
	</div>
	<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/f/fb/Glyphid_Dreadnought.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20200716213405" width="400" height="300" alt="Dreadnought">
	<p>Possibly the scariest bugs that Hoxxes has thrown at us yet. Strong, Agile, and tough to take down
	Their yellow, black and orange carapece is virutally industructable and unlike praetorians, dreadnoughts
	have their bulbs encased with a softer shell. To make matters worse, dreadnoughts are capable of of rapidly regenerating the shell that covers their bulb.
	As a Greenbeard, you will not be expected to go onto missions
	with the intention of fighting them. Thus, our primary recommendation upon meeting a Dreadnought is simple: Run.</p>
	<!-- I could go into the specific Dreadnoughts but you don't encounter
	them in missions until you do the mission associated with them. so it feels
	unecissary to do so. -->
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h2 "text-align:center">Macteras</h2>
	</div>
	<p "text-align:center"> Mactera Aliens are insectoid creatures that are often seen flying around the caverns of Hoxxes IV.
	They are typically characterized by their round bodies and glowing sacs that they use to store energy.</p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Mactera Spawn</h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/c/c5/Mactera_spawn.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20180604074938" width="400" height="300" alt="Mactera spawn">
	<p>The most common type of mactera you will encounter.
	When they get ready to spit their acid at you, they will bend back and
	their bellies will begin to glow a brighter yellow. They are particulary vulnerable
	when doing this, and it takes them a brief period of time to preform this action again.
	You shouldn't underestimate them, as acid spit by a mactera spawn is still acid. </p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Mactera Tri-jaws</h3> 
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/f/f4/Mactera_Tri-Jaw.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20210205192729" width="400" height="300" alt="Mactera Tri-Jaw">
	<p>A Mactera spawn that has mutated to have three trisected jaws that hoots three explosive
	spines at once. They are pretty deadly and should be handled with care. Like all mactera,
	it's attack is still easy to telegraph, but it has the ability to cover a greater area with its
	attack. Very lethal if all  three shots are able to connect on an unexpecting dwarf.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Mactera Grabbers</h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/a/a9/Mactera_grabber.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20181102071415" width="400" height="300" alt="Mactera Grabber">
	<p>Possibly one of the most annoying and aggressive species found in Hoxxes.
	They try to grab dwarves, take them to a high spot in the cavern, and crack them like a nut.
	They are easily telegraphed by their loud screech before they attempt to grab something. If they
	have a hold of somone, they will be sure to let you know. While carrying its prey, it is not known
	to try and eat it, thus making them far more of a nuisance (but still dangerous).</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Mactera Goo-Bombers </h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/b/b6/Mactera_goo_bomber.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20181102071314" width="400" height="300" alt="Mactera Goo-Bomber">
	<p>Mactera Goo-Bombers are the bloated, overweight cousin of the Mactera Spawn.
	It flies slower than standard Mactera, but it carries two, large pulsating sacs of goo.
	This goo is used by the Goo-Bomber to trap unsuspecting prey under it. These sacs
	are highly vulnerable to gunfire (or pickaxes, but its not suggested). Just don't be under it when it pops.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Mactera Brundles </h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/2/29/Mactera_Brundle.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20210205192644" width="400" height="300" alt="Mactera Brundle">
	<p> Mactera spawn but they are heavly armored with dark scale plating all around its body.
	Dispite this, it is still possible to see its belly light up when it gets ready to spit its
	acid at you. Suprisingly resilient for a mactera, and is not afraid to get up close and personal with you.</p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h2 style="text-align:center">Naedocytes</h2>
	</div>
	<p style="text-align:center"> Naedocytes are less common than Mactera and Glyphids. Naedocytes not accompanied by a breeder are
	exclusivley found in the Dense Biozone and the Glacial Strata. They are small, jellyfish-like creatures that attack by using
	electric shocks. They are very frail however, a simple swing of your pickaxe will typically do the job. </p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Naedocyte Shockers</h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/b/bf/Jelly_Shocker.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190910114331" width="400" height="300" alt="Naedocyte Shocker">
	<p>The standard Naedocyte you will see on your ventures through Hoxxes. Small, annoying, but deadly in large numbers.</p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Naedocyte Breeders</h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/f/f2/Naedocyte_Breeder.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20190910113738" width="400" height="300" alt="Naedocyte Breeder">
	<p>Breeders themselves are harmless. However, the Naedocyte Hatchlings that spawn from
	the eggs it drops on the ground are not harmless. This makes any naedocyte Breeder kill on site.
	They are resilent, however crafty swarves have learned that a single well-detonated cryo grenade is enough to freeze
	the beast and make it shatter on the ground. </p>
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Naedocyte Hatchlings</h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/d/d1/Naedocyte_Hatchling.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20190906114630" width="400" height="300" alt="Naedocyte Hacthling">
	<p>Hatchlings usually are only found around areas where a breeder is nearby.
	They are smaller than Shockers and are more purple than blue compared to shockers.
	Despite being smaller, you should not underestimate them. They are deadly in 
	high swarms.</p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h3>Naedocyte Cave Cruiser</h3>
	</div>
	<img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deeprockgalactic_gamepedia_en/images/0/05/Jelly.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20200721103558" width="400" height="300" alt="Naedocyte Cave Cruiser">
	<p> Completley docile variants of Naedocytes. They can be found floating around the
	Dense Biozone sucking up static charge in the air. Harmless. </p>
	
	<div class="Sub_Heading">
	<h2 style="text-align:center">Others</h2>
	</div>
	<div class = "The_Links">
	<p style="text-align:center">There other countless other creautres for you to find on your journey through the depths of Hoxxes.
	However, we will not be listing all of them on this page. The Catalog was made to give you a quick and easy snip of information
	to help you prepare for for your first expiditons. Dwarves eager to learn more about Hoxxes' natural wildlife are encouraged to 
	read up on their  <a href= "https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/">Miner's Mannual.</a></p>

	<p style="text-align:center">A good rule of thumb is that if it looks hostile, than treat it as such. </p>
<!-- Sorry to all of the 2 deep rock fans but I'm not doubling this page length with all of the special variants
and natural wildlife. I took it as enough to just go over the non-rival Tech/parsite creatures. What do you want me to say
